# JRM-HW3-PasswordGenerator
The purpose of this assignment was for the student to demonstrate an understanding if "if/else" statements and return loops in order to create a functioning password generator.

# Process
I initially needed to set up a series of arrays for the password generator to pull characters from. I was unable to find a more convenient method to list an alphabetical array without creating a one time use function, so for the sake of making sure my code was functional, I listed each item individually.
